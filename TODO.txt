UISF FUTURE FEATURES/CHANGES

Graphics and Widgets
- Use an external Colors library (see Hackage in general, but my inspiration is from the Diagrams package)
- Extend UIText with vector fonts and scalable font sizes.
- Make UIText automatically simplify itself; fix default color not always being used.
- mkBasicWidget should be (a -> b) and its draw routine should take either a or b or both.  Then, I can make a dynamic label that prints its input.  Or maybe not.
- Consider adding a refresh signal of some sort that is automatically provided to widgets that just "re-emerge" from an unused branch of arrow choice.  That way, if they were left in an odd state when the switch happens, they can be normal when they come back.  Alternatively, perhaps widgets can be coded so that they can gracefully fix themselves even when given a NoUIEvent
- Like the 'S' widgets, perhaps I could make 'D' widgets which are dynamic (e.g. a button or label with dynamic text, a radio with dynamic options, etc).  

Testing
- make a cabal "test-suite" (or second library or something like that?) that compiles the various example files.
- Can I make a test version of runUI that, instead of actually running the UISF, runs it for a few ticks with interesting click/keystroke events and makes sure that the GUI being tested doesn't blackhole?  Are there other ways to auto-test GUIs?

Bugs and Performance
- Add settability (but also a way to disable settability for performance reasons).
- Address the common memory leaks (perhaps force delay to take NFData args and then deepseq them)
- - Leak is noticeable even when just checking if a (MouseMove pt `inside` bbx) in a simple button
- Make the underlying arrow structure *NOT* an automaton.  Perhaps performance would get better if it were instead some sort of ArrowState business with manual, per-tick feedback (i.e. built-in settability)

Other
- Remove (deprecate) eventBuffer from the library (add it to Euterpea where it belongs)
- Add support for multiple open windows (update 7Guis to use a second window in circle drawing example)
