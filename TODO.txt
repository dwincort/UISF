UISF future features/changes
- remove the ArrowTime class and replace it with (ArrowReader Time) or something like that?
- make the output of asyncC (and asyncC') be monoidal
- Redo the color stuff in SOE so it's cleaner; perhaps remove Color as a datatype and replace it with values of RGB; then export RGB and those colors; what is RGBA?
- Put together a proper interface for SOE to ease the process of adapting UISF to work with other graphical back-ends
    maybe make a GraphicLib class to make it more plug-and-play?
    Switch from GLFW to OpenGL
- make a data type UIText: UIText may be expanded (for instance with font, size, etc.) but is essentially a list of (textColor, bgColor, String).  Label takes a UIText, and certain versions of textbox work with UIText
- mergeE is basically a generic mappend (especially since everyone uses it that way anyway).  How about we remove mergeE entirely and define ~++ as mappend and have UISF export that by default
- make a cabal "test-suite" (or second library or something like that?) that compiles the various example files.
- Can I make a test version of runUI that, instead of actually running the UISF, runs it for a few ticks with interesting click/keystroke events and makes sure that the GUI being tested doesn't blackhole?  Are there other ways to auto-test GUIs?
- mkBasicWidget should be (a -> b) and its draw routine should take either a or b or both.  Then, I can make a dynamic label that prints its input.  Or maybe not.
- Add settability, but also a way to disable settability (for performance reasons).
- Consider adding a refresh signal of some sort that is automatically provided to widgets that just "re-emerge" from an unused branch of arrow choice.  That way, if they were left in an odd state when the switch happens, they can be normal when they come back.
- Make a version of asyncE that can perform an IO computation.
